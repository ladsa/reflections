What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it makes a directory and a .git folder in which it saves the history of each
file and commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 it's an intermediate stage which contains files that are chosen to go to the
 repository, it's somehow like a waiting room, which those who gonna meet the
 doctor wait there till they go to the doctor's room.
